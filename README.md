# LMOptim
A Levenberg-Marquardt based optimizer to perform adjustment on RASPA simulations (and more comming...)

## TODOs
- ** Check compatibility with the APOLO Cluster/slurm cluster **
- Implement the standard error of the regression
- Check how to remove console printing from the RASPA on the console
- Implement log files for the Jacobian and the estimates of each step

# LMOptim
A Levenberg-Marquardt based optimizer to perform adjustment on RASPA simulations (and more comming...)

## Current version

V0.1.0 Alfa
- Stable but not fully tested version
- Some major changes expected in the future

## TODOs
- **Check compatibility with the APOLO Cluster/slurm cluster**
- Implement the standard error of the regression
- Check how to remove console printing from the RASPA on the console
- Implement log files for the Jacobian and the estimates of each step
- Usage manual

### More TODOs
This items are not critical so they will be saved to further implementations
- Extend error handling
- Extend the interfaces to: GROMACS, Python algorithms, Rust algorithms
- Implement dynamic damping-factor
- Benchmarking
